Implementation of a few algorithms from fomal logic, which I worked on as part of a school project.

# Algorithms Implemented
1. Solving propositional calculus expressions using truth tables (PCTruthTables).
2. Solving first order logic expression using the Tableaux method (FOLTableaux).
3. Solving modal propositional calculus expressions using Tableaux (Modal_Calculus).
